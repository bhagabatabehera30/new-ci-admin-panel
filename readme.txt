The login screen will appear.

To login, I am going to provide the user-email ids and password below.

**System Administrator Account :**

email : admin@admin.com

password : admin

**Manager Account :**

email :  manager@manager.com

password : manager

**Employee Account :**

email : employee@employee.com

password : employee

Once you logged in with System Administrator account, you can create user or edit previous user if you want.
